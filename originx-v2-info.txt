THE OVERALL FLOW OF ORIGINX V2.0

Nft owner deposit NFT to contract
contract fractionalizes ervc 721 (divisible) into multiple fractional tokens
then a raffle is created. contributions are listed
users buy contributions - more contributions, higher probability of winning a fractional Nft,
NFT owners get a 10% incentive compared with the nftPrice
a determining factor should be formed to determine the total charity amount to be raised as well
as the raffle pool.
The price model should be in the form of giving all stakeholders a win-win
ex. charity amount + 10% user incentive + some amount to the dApp as operational cost
Charities can sign up with the dedicated charity sign up page

Example Calculation:

n = number of fractional tokens ({min. 100 to 10000 for values >= 10ETH && 
    min. 1000 to 10000 for values < 10ETH})
nftPrice: 10 ETH
NFT owner Incentive: 10% of raffle pool
Target Charity Amount: 60% of raffle pool
Reserve prize pool: 2xFloor Price (reserved rewards)
Number of Contributions avaliable for purchase: 2n (if n=100, then total number of contributions is 200)
Each Contribution Price: 0.075 ETH (Floor Price / 2n). { Early users get low price high contributions,
    which increases higher probability of winning fractional Nfts.Post (n%50) + n contributions,
    Price is Fixed at a rate of }

challenges:
    1. The NFT price, we have to source the owner's original NFT
    price, preventing the owner from setting the inflated price.

    2. The determination of dynamicRandomValue

Possiblities:
Set Fixed Percentage rewards for both NFT owners and contributors
. Integrating with external price oracles:

Chainlink Price Feeds: Integrate Chainlink Price Feeds to access real-time market data for individual NFTs. 
This ensures transparency and reduces the risk of manipulation by NFT owners setting inflated prices.

NFT Price Oracles: Utilize specialized NFT price oracles like CoinGecko or OpenSea API to fetch floor 
price data for NFT collections. This allows for fair raffle entry based on the current market value of the 
collection.

Dynamic Pricing: You could implement dynamic pricing where the contribution price 
increases as more contributions are received, creating a sense of urgency and 
potentially increasing the total raffle pool.

Reserve Price: Consider setting a minimum reserve price for the raffle. 
If this price is not met, the raffle could be canceled or the NFT could be 
returned to the owner.

Multi-Tier Contributions: Offer different contribution tiers with varying rewards, such 
as bonus raffle entries or early access to future raffles, to cater to varying budgets 
and engagement levels.

created chainLink Automation, have to use this into automating the function to call
the pickWinners function upon conditions according to pickWinnersCheck.

PoC MVP:

function createRaffle:
 This function is used to create raffle. This function takes in the totalFractionsOfNFT, depending
 on the factors of the nftPrice

 set an eligible NFT by checking if it is greater than or equals to 1 ETH
    1. input params:
        - raffleName
        - description
        - nftPrice
        - endTime
        - totalFractionsOfNFT (random number of 50 ~ 100) only uint
        - nftId
        - nftContractAddress
        - nftName
    2. output:
        - raffleId

    This function calls the calculateTotalAvailableContributions by passing relevant values.

    Finds the dynamicPriceRandom value according to the nftPrice.

    Calculates the reserved raffle pool for the raffleId, i.e., nftPrice + (nftPrice % 50).

function calculateTotalAvailableContributions:

    1. IP:
        - raffleId
        - totalFractionsOfNFT

    It simply calculates the value of totalAvailableContributions by multiplying the variable
    totalFractionsOfNFT by 2. This function also sets the global value of totalAvailableContributions
    for that raffleId only once.

function calculateReservedPrice:

    1.IP:
        - raffleId
        - nftPrice
    
    if the nftPrice if less than 5 ETH return 5 % of nftPrice
    if the nftPrice if less than 5~10 ETH return 4 % of nftPrice
    if the nftPrice if less than 10~15 ETH return 3 % of nftPrice
    if the nftPrice if less than 15~20 ETH return 2 % of nftPrice
    if the nftPrice if less than 20~30 ETH return 1 % of nftPrice

function buyContributions:
 This function let's user to buy contributions for a particular raffle by paying the contribution
 price along with platform fee, by implementing dynamic pricing.

     1.IP:
        - raffleId
        - totalContributionsRequired

 How is each contribution price is determined:
    Each contributionPrice is determined by using a dynamic price model:
        - The Initial Price of the contribution is set by (nftPrice / totalAvailableContributions)
        - totalAvailableContributions is calculated by rounding off 1.5 * totalFractionsOfNFT
        - reserved threshold value is calculated by nftPrice * 2.5

    Example:

    nftPrice = 0.5 ETH
    reservedThresholdValue = nftPrice * 2.5, if 1 ETH, then 2.5 ETH as threshold
    totalFractionsOfNFT = 40, random number between 10 to 50 multiples of 10
    dynamicPriceRandom = 5684, random number between 1000 to 10000
    totalAvailableContributions = 60, (Math.round(1.5 * totalFractionsOfNFT));
    dynamicPriceRandomValue = 0.00008796622097114708, (nftPrice / dynamicPriceRandom);

    Initial Contribution Price:  0.008333333333333333 (nftPrice / totalAvailableContributions)
    Contribution1 = 0.008333333333333333 + 0.00008796622097114708 = 0.008421299554304481
    Contribution2 = 0.008421299554304481 +  0.00008796622097114708 = 0.008509265775275629
    Contribution3 = 0.008509265775275629 + 0.00008796622097114708 = 0.008597231996246776

    .
    .
    .
    .
    .
    Contribution(n) = {value} + 0.00008796622097114708 = {newValue}
    And total Value of contribution is >= reserved threshold value, all the contributions stay
    unchanged.

    here it goes on.. until the price reaches somewhere nearer the threshold value (5.805).
    Now computer the formula for this pricing model so that i can implement it in smart contract.


    n1 + n2 = (n1*random(1)) + n3 = (n2*random(2)) + ..... + nn = (nn * random(n)), where random(n) equals
    to reserved threshold value.
