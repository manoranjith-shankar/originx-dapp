THE OVERALL FLOW OF ORIGINX V2.0

Nft owner deposit NFT to contract
contract fractionalizes ervc 721 (divisible) into multiple fractional tokens
then a raffle is created. contributions are listed
users buy contributions - more contributions, higher probability of winning a fractional Nft,
NFT owners get a 10% incentive compared with the NFT floor price
a determining factor should be formed to determine the total charity amount to be raised as well
as the raffle pool.
The price model should be in the form of giving all stakeholders a win-win
ex. charity amount + 10% user incentive + some amount to the dApp as operational cost

Example Calculation:

n = number of fractional tokens ({min. 100 to 10000 for values >= 10ETH && 
    min. 1000 to 10000 for values < 10ETH})
NFT Floor Price: 10 ETH
NFT owner Incentive: 10% of raffle pool
Target Charity Amount: 60% of raffle pool
Reserve prize pool: 2xFloor Price (reserved rewards)
Number of Contributions avaliable for purchase: 2n (if n=100, then total number of contributions is 200)
Each Contribution Price: 0.075 ETH (Floor Price / 2n). { Early users get low price high contributions,
    which increases higher probability of winning fractional Nfts.Post (n%50) + n contributions,
    Price is Fixed at a rate of }

Possiblities:
Set Fixed Percentage rewards for both NFT owners and contributors

Dynamic Pricing: You could implement dynamic pricing where the contribution price 
increases as more contributions are received, creating a sense of urgency and 
potentially increasing the total raffle pool.

Reserve Price: Consider setting a minimum reserve price for the raffle. 
If this price is not met, the raffle could be canceled or the NFT could be 
returned to the owner.

Multi-Tier Contributions: Offer different contribution tiers with varying rewards, such 
as bonus raffle entries or early access to future raffles, to cater to varying budgets 
and engagement levels.
